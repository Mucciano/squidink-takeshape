# TakeShape Scaffolding

This is a scaffolding project to help get you started using TakeShape (TS) to build a static website.

*Before you start you'll need to set up a static site in TakeShape before you run `yarn run init`
 
1. `git clone [YOUR-PROJECT-NAME]` this repo to your machine
2. `cd` to [YOUR-PROJECT-NAME]
3. `yarn install` - This will install all dependencies including the takeshape-cli `tsg`
 - If you want to install TakeShape ClI globally `npm install -g takeshape-cli`
4. `yarn run init` - Follow the command prompts to set up your local enviornment to communicate with TakeShape
 - If you want to
6. `yarn run start` -  The server runs on [http://localhost:5000]() by default
7. `yarn run deploy` - Deploy your site to TakeShape!

## Before You Start
If you're using an IDE, Atom or JetBrains, we recommend using graphql-config https://graphcool.github.io/graphql-config/. This plugin making writing graphql queries a breeze 

Files and directories in this repo are designed to get you up and running with TS in seconds. After you poke around a bit you'll see how easy it is to lay in your own build processes and tools. One of the core concepts of TS is to do just enough and provide just enough structure to make your life easier without getting in your way. We want you to be creative. 

## Project Structure

- src - Holds  files or directories that will be process either by the TakeShape static site generator or by your own build process. 
  - templates
- static - (configurable in tsg.yml) Anything inside the static folder will be copied over as it appears into the build folder. If you have a build process to generate files like scss into css or combine js files they should output into the static folder or in subdirectories of the static folder.
   
**TakeShape Configuration**
 - `.graphqlrc` - Automatically generated by `init`. Reference to the TS endpoint
 - `.tsgrc` - Automatically generated by `init`.  Details to connect to a specific project on the TS platform
 - `tsg.yml` - Configuration options to build your project including paths to relevant directories, routes and data context

**Build Configuration** 
 - `.gitignore` - What files to ignore if you're using git (you should use some form of version control, if you aren't you're doing it wrong).
 
**Dependency Management**
 - `yarn.lock` - Automatically generated after your run `yarn install`
 - `package.json` - Serves two purposes, identifies the packages that will be installed when you run `yarn install`. Secondly establishes the various commands that can be executed by `yarn run` ex- `yarn run init`, or `yarn run start`, and `yarn run deploy`. You can add your own commands here to create your own build process.  

## Templating

TakeShape uses the Nunjucks templating language. Nunjucks is a powerful templating language and comes with all of the features you've come to expect.

 - Block inheritance
 - Autoescaping
 - Macros
 
You can find detailed Templating Docs on the Nunjucks site: (https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/templating.html
